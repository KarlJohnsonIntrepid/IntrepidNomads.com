    <p class="blog-post-meta"> by <a href="#">Karl and Leanne</a></p>

    <p>
        We are Karl and Leanne, a couple from the small coastal town of Blyth in England. In May 2015 we made the life changing decision to quit our jobs, sell our stuff, and go travelling. This was one of the most exciting and terrifying decisions we have ever made, but after spending several years chained to our desks, with an itch for adventure that just wouldn’t go away, we decided to follow our dreams and hit the road.

    <br />
    <p> We have been travelling for just over a year now and have used this blog to document our experiences of travelling as a couple on a budget.</p>

        What a year it has been! We started in Vancouver and headed South on a road trip which took us down the west coast of America. From there we travelled through Mexico into Central America and onto South America, reaching the Southern tip of Argentina.
        After the Americas we took a short detour back to sunny Blyth before making our way to Australia via, Romania, Dubai, India, Malaysia and Singapore.

        It has been an exceptional year, with many highs, but also a few lows, including a scary near-death experience! We hope this blog can be used as a way for people to follow us on our travels and inspire people to set out on their own journeys.
