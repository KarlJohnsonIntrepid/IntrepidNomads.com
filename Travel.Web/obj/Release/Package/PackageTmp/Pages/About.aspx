        <p>
            This blog isn’t just a way for us to capture our memories of past trips but rather a way to track, share and plan our next adventure.
                 This is going to be ‘The Big Trip’. I have always been passionate about travelling, ever since going on my first trip to India and New Zealand when I was 18, I was hooked.
                 Suddenly a whole world of new people, places and experiences became open to me and I knew I wouldn’t be able to settle until I had explored more.
                 I’m sure this is a familiar feeling for many travellers, and one which I can’t imagine ever going away.

            It wasn’t too hard to convert Karl into the traveller’s way of thinking, especially after our wonders round South East Asia. However, as with many dreams, life got in the way. We went to university, studied hard, got good jobs and managed to get ourselves to a reasonably happy and successful place. But this was not enough. Ever since I went to India I have dreamt of standing in the airport with a one way ticket, not knowing when I will be coming back. That to me is freedom. All my other trips were restricted by an end date. Something which always loomed over and forced you to move on and travel faster, sometimes I look back and think ‘I wish I had stayed there longer’. 
                 Obviously I’m not naïve, I understand that the one main restriction to open ended travel is money, but as most travellers will tell you it is definitely cheaper to travel slowly.

            So this is where we are now. After making the decision a year ago that if we didn’t go now we never would, we started to save save save and plan plan plan plan,
                 so that now we are less than 1 year away from our big adventure! However, I am trying to suppress my urge to plan too much as don’t want this trip to be ‘itinerarized’,
                 I want us to have the freedom to wonder where we feel is right and see where the world takes us.

            Please feel free to come back and visit out site to see how we get on. It is our aim to use this blog as a way to share our experiences of a couple travelling on a budget, and hopefully will help to inspire other fellow adventurers to go out and travel. 
                After all, there is a whole planet out there to explore.
